src / assets /* the assets folder is where you'll find all the static resources of the project,
                   such as images, fonts, icons, and other media files. */

src / components /* houses all the reusable React components in the project. Each component is
                   encapsulated, meaning it has its own styles, logic, and markup. Components can
                   be easily combined and reused throughout the application, ensuring a consistent
                   look and feel. */

src / constants /* the constants folder contains files with predefined values that remain unchanged
                   throughout the application. */

src / hooks /* in the hooks folder, you will find custom React hooks that abstract and manage
                   complex logic or side effects. */

src / pages /* the pages folder contains components that represent individual pages or views
                   in the application. Each file in this folder is responsible for the layout and
                   rendering of a specific page or view. */

src / styles /* the styles folder contains global styling files and style-related utilities.
                   This is where you'll find the base styles, theme configuration, and any
                   CSS-in-JS or CSS preprocessor files. */

src / types /* in the types folder, you'll find TypeScript type definitions and interfaces for
                   the entire project. */

                   that assists your components and pages. */
