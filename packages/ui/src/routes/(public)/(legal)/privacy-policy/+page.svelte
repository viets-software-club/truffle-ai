	<p>
		Our top priority is customer data security, and, as such, we may process only minimal user data,
		only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the website. Information collected
		automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical
		information regarding website usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in
		such a way that it would identify any particular user of the system. Collected or accessed
		information from third parties on which we host and/or make our website accessible is outside of
		our ownership and accessibility (e.g. server logs) as such we can not exclude that these servies
		may collect, share and store data including personal information.
	</p>
	<p>
		We use the <em>Order Information</em> that we collect generally to fulfill any orders placed
		through the Site (including processing your payment information, arranging for shipping, and
		providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this
		<em>Order Information</em> to:
	</p>
	<ul class="list-disc pl-4 mb-4">
		<li>Communicate with you;</li>
		<li>Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and</li>
		<li>
			When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or
			advertising relating to our products or services.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		You can not use the Application without telling us who you are or revealing information, by
		which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If you wish to use some
		of the website's features, for example sign up and in or you wish to receive our newsletter or
		provide other details by filling a form, you may provide personal data to us, such as your
		email, first name, last name, city of residence, organization, telephone number, passwords, and
		social media accounts.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can choose not to provide us with your personal data, but then you may not be able to use
		the application. For example, you won't be able to log in to the application or receive any
		emails from us.

		Please remember that third party services and Service Providers, we use, may collect information
		of you even if you haven't specifically provided them with information this may include the IP
		addresses, access times and more. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory to
		use <a href="https://truffle.tools">https://truffle.tools</a> and subsites are welcome to
